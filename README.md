# ChatRoomWithBot
This is a Chat Room application with bot capabilities.

## Features
  - Chat Room for talking with other users
  - .NET Identity Core for users authentication
  - Consume Chat Bots

## Technical Details
The back end was built in [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), which implements a microservices architecture using [CQRS Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) with [MeadiatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).

For real time communications, [SignalR](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/SignalR) was used between users, which is consumed over [MeadiatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) notifications and events, and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html) for handling bots requests and responses.

The front end was done in [Angular 8](https://angular.io/)
